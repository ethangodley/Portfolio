##Web Development Portfolio

#####This website was made to showcase my portfolio of web development projects in order to showcase to clients and prospective employers

#####The current iteration of the website contains all content of website with initial syling. The image gallery consisting of portfolio projects is yet to be filled with projects, however to ensure functionality, project links have been replaced with a placeholder website stating "Coming soon..." Styling is to updated to make portfolio more visually appealing.

#####This portfolio currently consists of HTML and CSS only, however it is likely javascript will be included in future iterations.

##### This is what my project is supposed to look like:
